## Project Description

This Chrome extension replicates the UI of a given web application.  More detailed information about the project's goals and specifics can be found in the [Google Doc](*link to google doc here*).

## Overview

The `vibe-ui-copier` Chrome extension allows you to create a visual replica of elements from any webpage you are viewing.  This can be useful for various purposes, such as A/B testing, design mirroring, or accessibility enhancements. The extension works by injecting a content script into the target webpage, which then identifies and duplicates specified UI elements. Communication between the content script and the extension's background script allows for dynamic updates and potential configuration options.

## Installation

1.  **Download the extension:** Download the latest release from [Link to Releases/Repository] (replace with actual link).
2.  **Open Chrome Extensions:** In Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3.  **Enable Developer Mode:** Toggle the "Developer mode" switch in the top right corner.
4.  **Load Unpacked:** Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory where you downloaded and extracted the extension files.

## Usage Examples

1.  **Basic Replication:** Once installed and enabled, navigate to the webpage you want to copy UI elements from. The extension will automatically try to identify and replicate the UI. (Note: Initial functionality may require configuration - see below)
2.  **Configuring Replication (Optional):** If a popup is integrated, click the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to access configuration options.  These options may allow you to:
    *   Select specific UI elements to replicate.
    *   Adjust the placement of the replicated elements.
    *   Customize the appearance of the replicated elements.

## Components

The extension comprises the following components:

*   **`manifest.json`:**  Defines the extension's metadata, permissions, and entry points. This file is required for all Chrome extensions.
*   **`background.js`:** Handles extension lifecycle events and communication between the content script and the popup (if any).  It manages tasks like:
    *   `onInstalled()`:  Called when the extension is installed or updated.
    *   `onMessage(message, sender, sendResponse)`: Handles messages received from content scripts or the popup.
    *   `fetchData(url)`: Fetches data from a specified URL.
    *   `storeData(key, value)`:  Stores data locally.
    *   `getData(key)`: Retrieves stored data.
*   **`content.js`:** Injects into the target webpage and replicates UI elements. Key functions include:
    *   `onPageLoad()`:  Executed when the page finishes loading.
    *   `replicateUI()`: Identifies and replicates UI elements.
    *   `observeDOMChanges()`:  Monitors the DOM for changes that require updating the replicated UI.
    *   `sendMessageToBackground(message)`: Sends messages to the background script.
    *   `handleReplicaEvents(event)`: Handles events triggered by the replicated UI elements.
*   **`popup.html`:**  Defines the structure of the extension's popup window.  (If applicable).
*   **`popup.js`:**  Controls the functionality of the popup window. Functions include:
    *   `init()`: Initializes the popup.
    *   `loadSettings()`: Loads user settings.
    *   `saveSettings()`: Saves user settings.
    *   `sendMessageToBackground(message)`: Sends messages to the background script.
    *   `displayData(data)`: Displays data in the popup.
*   **`style.css`:**  Contains the CSS styles for the extension (e.g., popup styling).

## Dependencies

*   **Chrome Browser:** The extension is designed to run within the Chrome browser.
*   **Manifest V3 Compatibility:** This extension is built upon the Manifest V3 standard for Chrome extensions.

## Project Plan Summary

This project's architecture utilizes a standard Chrome extension approach with the following flow:

1.  The extension installs and activates.
2.  The user navigates to a target webpage.
3.  The content script injects itself into the webpage.
4.  The content script analyzes the webpage and identifies elements for replication.
5.  The content script creates a replica of those elements.
6.  The content script communicates with the background script for data handling or settings.
7.  The user interacts with the replicated UI, triggering events handled by the content script.
8.  The background script manages persistent data or external service communication.
